# NOAA GOES 16 on CEPAGRI 

Data from NOAA's GOES-R series satellite is available on cpa.unicamp.br. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates a constellation of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) to provide continuous weather imagery and monitoring of meteorological and space environment data for the protection of life e outros fins.GOES satellites provide critical atmospheric, oceanic, climatic and space weather products supporting weather forecasting and warnings, climatologic analysis and prediction, ecosystems management, safe and efficient public and private transportation, and other.

The satellites provide advanced imaging with increased spatial resolution, 16 spectral channels, and up to 1 minute scan frequency for more accurate forecasts and timely warnings.

The real-time feed and full historical archive of original resolution Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) radiance data (Level 1b) and full resolution Cloud and Moisture Imager (CMI) products (Level 2) are freely available on cpa.unicamp.br.


## About the Data
All data files from GOES-16 are provided in netCDF4 format. The GOES-16 data is hosted in the `noaa-goes16`.

`<Product>/<Year>/<Day of Year>/<Hour>/<Filename>`

where:

- `<Product>` is the product generated from CEPAGRI

  - ABI-L1b-RadF - Advanced Baseline Imager Level 1b Full Disk
  - ABI-L2-CMIPF - Advanced Baseline Imager Level 2 Cloud and Moisture Imagery Full Disk
  - ABI-L2-RRQPEF - Advanced Baseline Imager Level 2 Rainfall Rate (Quantitative Precipitation Estimate) Full Disk
  - GLM-L2-LCFA - Geostationary Lightning Mapper Level 2 Lightning Detection 
  
- `<Year>` is the year the netCDF4 file was created
- `<Day of Year>` is the numerical day of the year (1-365) julian day
- `<Hour>` is the hour the data observation was made
- `<Filename>` is the name of the file containing the data. These are compressed and encapsulated using the netCDF4 standard.

A `<Filename>` is delineated by underscores '_' and looks like this:

`OR_ABI-L1b-RadF-M3C02_G16_s20171671145342_e20171671156109_c20171671156144.nc`

where:

- `OR`: Operational system real-time data
- `ABI-L1b-RadF-M3C02` is delineated by hyphen '-':
  - `ABI`: is ABI Sensor
  - `L1b`: is processing level, L1b data or L2
  - `Rad`: is radiances. Other products include CMIP (Cloud and Moisture Imagery products) and MCMIP (multichannel CMIP).
  - `F`: is full disk (normally every 15 minutes), C is continental U.S. (normally every 5 minutes), M1 and M2 is Mesoscale region 1 and region 2 (usually every minute each)
  - `M3`: is mode 3 (scan operation), M4 is mode 4 (only full disk scans every five minutes â€“ no mesoscale or CONUS)
  - `C02`: is channel or band 02, There will be sixteen bands, 01-16
- `G16`: is satellite id for GOES-16 (future G17)
- `s20171671145342`: is start of scan time
  - 4 digit year
  - 3 digit day of year
  - 2 digit hour
  - 2 digit minute
  - 2 digit second
  - 1 digit tenth of second
- `e20171671156109`: is end of scan time
- `c20171671156144`: is netCDF4 file creation time
- `.nc` is netCDF file extension

## About Processing
All data is processed on the okul server and transferred and copied to the vialactea server.
The vialactea server does the last processing so that the netCDF4 data becomes an image.

where:

On the `vialactea` server.
